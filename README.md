# EFI-Linker
It'll eventually easy you in creating an EFI image.

Lastly tested on clang. Made to work on GCC too (tested on 6.1.1).

You will need to include/compile "main.c" in your project in order to work. "main.h" is the header with the functions
you will want to use.

Uefi image created using this helper was tested on Asrock B75M-GL motherboard firmware.
